## Encryptix Internship Program

## Task - 1 :  MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

# Problem Statement :

* Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
* We can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## Task - 2 : CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

# Problem Statement :

 * Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions,
   and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Task - 3 : CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

 # Problem Statement :

   * Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data,
     including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.
